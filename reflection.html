                <p>Responsive design is an indispensable subject in WEB development . Nowadays , number of electronic devices available in market such as smartphones
                    , laptop , tablets , etc and their dimensions of display varies acoordingly.The concept of responsive design helps to tranform website and display
                    according to the screen size of devices . There are number of benefits of using responsive design in WEB developing. It helps to display all the contents of
                    webpage and adjust within screen sizes of devices and perfect view can be seen in any device without missing any content of webpage. It also helps to authenticate
                    that the contents are same , can be fit in all devices and also maintained. This concept also helps to enhances the emanation of website. 
                </p>

                <p>As Responsive design has many advantages , it is also helpul to us in web technologies. In this type of design , elements of webpage are
                    developed in such a way that they gets restructured as per the screen size of device or depending on the browser's width. In responsive design ,
                    as per the size of screen or width of browser , a breakpoint is calculated and contents of webpage are shown as per rules determined by these breakpoints.
                    The concept of responsive design is very crucial , because it checks every function and also checks that the website is displayed or not and adapt with screen
                    as per the display , due to this reason it is a reliable design. This design solves lot of problem and save our time. We don't need to make separate HTML code 
                    , CSS code and Javascript code for different types of devices , because when we use this design , a single file is utilized and manage as per need. 
                    There are many popular frameworks which provides a reliable experience and helps in the making of web responsive websites which are much faster and 
                    compatible. Some of the frameworks are Bootstrap, Foundation, Skeleton, etc. 
                </p>

                <p>The research and analysis conducted during the design and development of web apps for different devices,
                    I gained knowledge on testing of web pages on different websites and on different devices and checking if the web apps are web responsive design or not.
                    The result of which I acquired an understanding of how to identify the issue in viewing the contents of the webpage.
                    The code should respond to the enduser’s device specs and configuration. The code being unresponsive will affect the user’s experience.
                   My aim is to build successful webpage that works efficiently on all electronic devices , for which i had done my research on developing web apps.
                </p>
                <p>From the start of semester I acquired skills in HTML. HTML allows us to design and format a webpage and the contents in it.
                   To add functionality to a web page, I familiarized myself with Javascript. 
                   To style the web page I had to learn CSS as well which allowed me to style and format the web page. I also learned about manipulating and accessing the web document
                   by gaining knowledge on DOM Document object Model. At end of this course , i have the basic knowledge and skills related to WEB development , which i use to
                   create website for practice, i also used to make javascript file and css file for it also. This final assessment also teached me many things , such as
                   validation of form , implementation of it using javascript and finally designing web page in official way.
